# Marine Resource Management
 Project for the Databases course

The project consisted in creating a database to support a hypothetical State management application for marine resources.
The project has been divided into two parts.

The first part focuses on the modeling of information and its coherence, ensured by the following two distinct models:
- The Entity-Association model and corresponding Integrity Restrictions.
- The Relational model and corresponding Integrity Restrictions.

The second part focuses on the development of a new application for the management of auctions of areas for the concession of marine resources, based on an existing Database:
- Present a new Entity-Association model that best translates the concepts materialized in the respective tables.
- Write the PHP scripts that allow, from a browser, participation in auctions, reading and writing the necessary information in the Database.
- Write new questions to a file with an SQL script.
- Adding a trigger and carrying out transactions.
- The creation of several indexes and the creation of a star schema and loading scripts in the database.

# Setup
